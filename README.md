Data Preprocessing Logic
A.	Loading and Parsing ECG Data
wfdb.rdsamp(): This function is used to read ECG signals from a file in WFDB format.
It loads the signal data and metadata (such as sampling frequency, signal names etc)
i.e. p_signal, fields = wfdb.rdsamp('data/100')
B.	Noise Removal with Low-Pass Filtering
Logic: ECG signals can contain noise from muscle contractions or electrical interference. A low-pass filter is applied to remove high-frequency noise and preserve the low-frequency ECG signal.
Process:
1.	Designing a low-pass filter: The filter is designed using the Butterworth filter (signal.butter()) with a cutoff frequency of 50 Hz, as higher frequencies in the ECG signal (above 50 Hz) are often considered noise.
2.	Filtering the signal: The signal is then passed through the filter using signal.filtfilt() to remove high-frequency components.
b, a = signal.butter(4, cutoff / (fs / 2), btype='low')
return signal.filtfilt(b, a, ecg_signal, axis=0)

C.	Normalization of the ECG Signal
Logic: Normalization ensures that the ECG signal values fall within a consistent range [0, 1], making it easier for the model to process.
 (ecg_signal - np.min(ecg_signal)) / (np.max(ecg_signal) - np.min(ecg_signal))
D.	Segmentation of ECG Signals
Logic: The ECG signal is split into smaller fixed-length windows (segments), making it easier for the model to learn from different sections of the signal.
The signal is divided into overlapping or non-overlapping segments (based on the window_size) of a fixed length (e.g., 720 data points corresponding to 2 seconds at a 360 Hz sampling frequency).
segment_length = fs * window_size
return [ecg_signal[i:i + segment_length] for i in range(0, len(ecg_signal), segment_length) if len(ecg_signal[i:i + segment_length]) == segment_length]

Creating smaller chunks (segments) of the ECG signal to be used as input for the model.

Labelling the Data
A.	Parsing Annotations
wfdb.rdann(): This function is used to read the annotation file, which contains information about the types of events (e.g., normal beats, abnormal beats) in the ECG signal.
Logic: Annotations are parsed for each ECG record, and the corresponding labels (normal or abnormal) are assigned to each segment based on the location of the annotations in the signal.
annotation = wfdb.rdann('data/100', 'atr')
B.	Labeling Segments
Logic: Each segment of the ECG signal is checked for the presence of abnormal beats (i.e., non-'N' annotations).
If an annotation indicates a non-normal (abnormal) beat, the entire segment is labeled as 1 (abnormal).
Otherwise, it is labeled as 0 (normal).
if symbol != 'N':  # Non-'N' annotations are considered abnormal
labels[j] = 1  # Assign abnormal label

Model Building Logic
A.	Neural Network Architecture
Purpose: The model aims to classify ECG segments as either normal or abnormal (arrhythmia detection).
Type: A 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used, which is well-suited for time-series data like ECG signals.
•	Convolutional Layers: Convolution layers extract features from the ECG signal, such as rhythm patterns or irregularities, by learning filters that highlight important patterns.
•	Fully Connected Layers: After feature extraction, the fully connected layers are responsible for making the final classification decision (normal or abnormal).
•	Output Layer: The output layer uses a sigmoid activation function to provide a binary output (0 or 1).
model = Sequential([
Conv1D(32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
Conv1D(64, kernel_size=3, activation='relu'),
Flatten(),
Dense(128, activation='relu'),
Dropout(0.5),
Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

B.	Model Training
Logic: The model is trained using the preprocessed ECG segments and their corresponding labels.
•	The loss function used is binary cross-entropy, as it is a binary classification problem (normal vs. abnormal).
•	Accuracy is used as the metric to evaluate the model's performance.
•	Validation: The model is validated on unseen data to ensure that it generalizes well.
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, validation_data=(X_val, y_val), epochs=50, batch_size=32)

Error Handling in Annotations
Parsing Errors
•	Error: Sometimes, the rdann() function might throw an error when reading the annotation files, especially due to file corruption or incompatibility (e.g., OverflowError in your case).
•	Solution: We try to handle such errors by skipping records or cleaning up annotation files manually.
___________________________________________________________________________
Evaluation
Metrics
•	Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions.
•	Precision: The percentage of positive predictions that were actually positive (useful in imbalanced datasets).
•	Recall: The percentage of actual positive samples that were correctly predicted.
•	F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
These metrics give a better understanding of the model's performance, especially in the presence of imbalanced data (normal vs. abnormal labels).
•	Confusion Matrix: It helps to visualize the model's performance, showing how many normal and abnormal samples were correctly classified.

CNN Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture used for training consists of multiple layers. Here's a breakdown of each component:
1.	Conv1D Layer (Convolutional Layer):
o	The first layer of the model applies a 1D convolution over the input ECG signal. This is because the data is sequential (i.e., time-series data like ECG).
o	The purpose of this layer is to detect local patterns such as peaks, trends, or other features in the ECG signal, which are critical for classification.
o	Kernel Size: The model uses a kernel size of 3 (a 3-point window) for detecting patterns.
o	Filters: The first Conv1D layer uses 32 filters, which means it will learn 32 different patterns/features from the input signal.
2.	Activation Function (ReLU):
o	After the convolution, the output is passed through a ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function. ReLU is commonly used in CNNs because it helps introduce non-linearity to the model while being computationally efficient.
3.	Second Conv1D Layer:
o	Another convolutional layer is added with 64 filters. This layer helps in extracting more complex patterns from the signal.
4.	Flatten Layer:
o	The Flatten layer converts the 2D data (after convolution) into a 1D vector so that it can be fed into fully connected layers.
5.	Dense Layer:
o	The first Dense layer is a fully connected layer with 128 neurons. This layer helps the network to combine the features extracted by the convolutional layers and learn higher-level abstractions.
6.	Dropout Layer:
o	The Dropout layer is used for regularization, which helps in preventing overfitting by randomly disabling some of the neurons during training.
7.	Final Dense Layer (Output Layer):
o	The output layer uses a sigmoid activation function, which is suitable for binary classification (normal vs. abnormal). The output is a single value representing the probability of the input being abnormal.
